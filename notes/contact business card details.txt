Here are my current notes:
Image:
For the image, it scales the image to the right size, then aligns it,
using a border of 9 pixels from the edge of the card. 50% would be 132
pixels (calculating the square root of half the card size, that is
pretty close. Square root is ~137 pixels). Multiply the percentage
integer by 264 and divide by 100 and we will call it good enough.

The scale defined for an image is actually for the area it will be occupying,
not the image itself. 50% means that 50% of the image area is being used.
Here is a full list of how the options behave:
    Image left: Image area is left %. Right border is 6-7 pixels.
        Fit to Edge: Scales it vertically to match
        Top Left: Scales horizontally to match. Places in top left.
        Top Center: Scales horizontally to match. Places in top center.
        Top Right: Scales horizontally to match. Places in top right.
        Center Left: Scales horizontally to match. Places in center left.
        Center: Scales horizontally to match. Places in center.
        Center Right: Scales horizontally to match. Places in center right.
        Bottom Left: Scales horizontally to match. Places in bottom left.
        Bottom Center: Scales horizontally to match. Places in bottom center.
        Bottom Right: Scales horizontally to match. Places in bottom right.
    Image Right: Image area is right %. Left border is 6-7 pixels.
        Fit to Edge: Scales it vertically to match
        Top Left:
        Top Center:
        Top Right:

        Bottom Center:
        Bottom Right:
    Image Top: Image area is top %. Bottom border is 6-7 pixels. Top border is none.
        Fit to Edge: Scales it horizontally to match.
        Top Left:
        Top Center:

    Image Bottom: Image area is bottom %. Top border is 6-7 pixels. Bottom border is 9 pixels.
        Fit to Edge: Scales it horizontally to match.
        Top Left:

        Bottom Center:
        Bottom Right:
    Text Only: No image.
    Background Image:
        Fit to Edge: Scales it horizontally to match.
        Top Left: Seems to want to scale it to leave 8 pixel border, but may not. Places to left.
        Top Center: Seems to want to scale it to leave 8 pixel border, but may not. Places in center.
        Top Right: Seems to want to scale it to leave 8 pixel border, but may not. Places to right.
        Center Left: Same as top left.
        Center: Same as top center.
        Center Right: Same as top right.
        Bottom Left: Same as top left.
        Bottom Center: Same as top center.
        Bottom Right: Same as top right.


Text:
For the text, the "align" is 8 blank pixels on the side you are aligning to. So
the edge of the text will be 8 pixels away from the edge of the canvas. The top
line of text is 10 pixels down from the top, however the way it aligns text from
the top is unclear. More research needed. If the line is going to go off the
page, it does truncate with a "..." and will go all the way to the very edge.
Text on a line below existing rendered line will not be rendered if it does not
entirely fit on the page vertically.

Additionally, font size may slightly increase distance to border. However, it
never goes below 8.
