msg-extractor
=============

Extracts emails and attachments saved in Microsoft Outlook's .msg files

The python package extract_msg automates the extraction of key email
data (from, to, cc, date, subject, body) and the email's attachments.

NOTICE
======
0.29.* is the branch that supports both Python 2 and Python 3. It is now only
receiving bug fixes and will not be receiving feature updates.

This module has a Discord server for general discussion. You can find it here:

Usage
-----

**To use it as a command-line script**:

::

     python -m extract_msg example.msg

This will produce a new folder named according to the date, time and
subject of the message (for example "2013-07-24_0915 Example"). The
email itself can be found inside the new folder along with the
attachments.

The script uses Philippe Lagadec's Python module that reads Microsoft
OLE2 files (also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format
or Compound Document File Format). This is the underlying format of
Outlook's .msg files. This library currently supports Python 3.6 and above.

The script was originally built using Peter Fiskerstrand's documentation of the
.msg format. Redemption's discussion of the different property types used within
Extended MAPI was also useful. For future reference, note that Microsoft have
opened up their documentation of the file format, which is what is currently
being used for development.


#########REWRITE COMMAND LINE USAGE#############
Currently, the README is in the process of being redone. For now, please
refer to the usage information provided from the program's help dialog:

                   msg [msg ...]

    extract_msg: Extracts emails and attachments saved in Microsoft Outlook's .msg files. https://github.com/TeamMsgExtractor/msg-extractor

    positional arguments:
      msg                   An MSG file to be parsed.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --use-content-id, --cid
                            Save attachments by their Content ID, if they have one. Useful when working with the HTML body.
      --dev                 Changes to use developer mode. Automatically enables the --verbose flag. Takes precedence over the --validate flag.
      --validate            Turns on file validation mode. Turns off regular file output.
      --json                Changes to write output files as json.
      --file-logging        Enables file logging. Implies --verbose level 1.
      -v, --verbose         Turns on console logging. Specify more than once for higher verbosity.
      --log LOG             Set the path to write the file log to.
      --config CONFIGPATH   Set the path to load the logging config from.
      --out OUTPATH         Set the folder to use for the program output. (Default: Current directory)
      --use-filename        Sets whether the name of each output is based on the msg filename.
      --dump-stdout         Tells the program to dump the message body (plain text) to stdout. Overrides saving arguments.
      --html                Sets whether the output should be HTML. If this is not possible, will error.
      --pdf                 Saves the body as a PDF. If this is not possible, will error.
      --wk-path WKPATH      Overrides the path for finding wkhtmltopdf.
      --wk-options [WKOPTIONS ...]
                            Sets additional options to be used in wkhtmltopdf. Should be a series of options and values, replacing the - or -- in the beginning with + or ++,
                            respectively. For example: --wk-options "+O Landscape"
      --prepared-html       When used in conjunction with --html, sets whether the HTML output should be prepared for embedded attachments.
      --charset CHARSET     Character set to use for the prepared HTML in the added tag. (Default: utf-8)
      --raw                 Sets whether the output should be raw. If this is not possible, will error.
      --rtf                 Sets whether the output should be RTF. If this is not possible, will error.
      --allow-fallback      Tells the program to fallback to a different save type if the selected one is not possible.
      --skip-body-not-found Skips saving the body if the body cannot be found, rather than throwing an error.
      --zip ZIP             Path to use for saving to a zip file.
      --save-header         Store the header in a separate file.
      --attachments-only    Specify to only save attachments from an msg file.
      --skip-hidden         Skips any attachment marked as hidden (usually ones embedded in the body).
      --no-folders          When used with --attachments-only, stores everything in the location specified by --out. Incompatible with --out-name.
      --skip-embedded       Skips all embedded MSG files when saving attachments.
      --extract-embedded    Extracts the embedded MSG files as MSG files instead of running their save functions.
      --out-name OUTNAME    Name to be used with saving the file output. Cannot be used if you are saving more than one file.
      --glob, --wildcard    Interpret all paths as having wildcards. Incompatible with --out-name.
      --ignore-rtfde        Ignores all errors thrown from RTFDE when trying to save. Useful for allowing fallback to continue when an exception happens.
      --progress            Shows what file the program is currently working on during it's progress.

**To use this in your own script**, start by using:

::

     import extract_msg

From there, open the MSG file:

::

     msg = extract_msg.openMsg("path/to/msg/file.msg")

Alternatively, if you wish to send a msg binary string instead of a file
to the ``extract_msg.openMsg`` Method:

::

     msg_raw = b'\xd0\xcf\x11\xe0\xa1\xb1\x1a\xe1\x00 ... \x00\x00\x00'
     msg = extract_msg.openMsg(msg_raw)

If you want to override the default attachment class and use one of your
own, simply change the code to:

::

     msg = extract_msg.openMsg("path/to/msg/file.msg", attachmentClass = CustomAttachmentClass)

where ``CustomAttachmentClass`` is your custom class.

Extra
-----

Check out the new project `msg-explorer`_ that allows you to open MSG files and
explore their contents in a GUI. It is usually updated within a few days of a
major release to ensure continued support. Because of this, it is recommended to
install it to a separate environment (like a vitural env) to not interfere with
your access to the newest major version of extract-msg.
