MSG test file

Purpose: Provide example of this file type

Document file type: MSG

Version: 1.0

Remark:



Example content:

The names "John Doe" for males, "Jane Doe" or "Jane Roe" for females,

or "Jonnie Doe" and "Janie Doe" for children, or just "Doe"

non-gender-specifically are used as placeholder names for a party whose

true identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, case, or

discussion. The names are also used to refer to acorpse or hospital

patient whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the

United States and Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking

countries including the United Kingdom itself, from where the use of

"John Doe" in a legal context originates. The names Joe Bloggs or John

Smith are used in the UK instead, as well as in Australia and New

Zealand. 



John Doe is sometimes used to refer to a typical male in other contexts

as well, in a similar manner to John Q. Public, known in Great Britain

as Joe Public, John Smith or Joe Bloggs. For example, the first name

listed on a form is often John Doe, along with a fictional address or

other fictional information to provide an example of how to fill in the

form. The name is also used frequently in popular culture, for example

in the Frank Capra film Meet John Doe. John Doe was also the name of a

2002 American television series. 



Similarly, a child or baby whose identity is unknown may be referred to

as Baby Doe. A notorious murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, referred

to the baby victim as Precious Doe. Other unidentified female murder

victims are Cali Doe and Princess Doe. Additional persons may be called

James Doe, Judy Doe, etc. However, to avoid possible confusion, if two

anonymous or unknown parties are cited in a specific case or action, the

surnames Doe and Roe may be used simultaneously; for example, "John Doe

v. Jane Roe". If several anonymous parties are referenced, they may

simply be labelled John Doe #1, John Doe #2, etc. (the U.S. Operation

Delego cited 21 (numbered) "John Doe"s) or labelled with other variants

of Doe / Roe / Poe / etc. Other early alternatives such as John Stiles

and Richard Miles are now rarely used, and Mary Major has been used in

some American federal cases.
