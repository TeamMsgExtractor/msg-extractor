Just a collection of helper scripts for the development of the module.

detect-prop-overlap.py: A script to detect properties in a file that are using the same name or property ID. Looks for instances of `_ensureSetX` to find conflicts and outputs a list of anything that is duplicated. Takes in the path to a file.
